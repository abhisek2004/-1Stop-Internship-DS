Data Science - Self  Paced Intern

# 🌟🚀 Exciting News Alert! 🚀🌟

I have completed my 1Stop Internship in Data Science! 🎉 During this self-paced internship from January 20, 2024, to March 31, 2024, i've achieved some remarkable milestones in this field. Let's delve into the projects you've undertaken:

1. **CREDIT EDA**:
   This project likely involved Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on credit-related data. In the world of finance, understanding patterns and trends within credit data is crucial for making informed decisions. You may have explored variables such as credit scores, payment history, debt-to-income ratios, and more. The insights gained from this analysis can be invaluable for financial institutions in assessing risk and making lending decisions. 📊💳

2. **Hate Speech Detection**:
   Hate speech detection is a critical application of natural language processing (NLP) in combating online toxicity and promoting a safer digital environment. Your project likely involved training machine learning models to identify and classify text as containing hate speech or not. This could have included preprocessing text data, feature engineering, and selecting appropriate algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). By developing effective hate speech detection models, you contribute to fostering inclusive online communities. 🚫🤬

3. **SMS-Spam Detection**:
   With the prevalence of spam messages inundating our mobile phones, building accurate SMS spam detection systems is essential. Your project may have involved using classification techniques to differentiate between legitimate messages and spam. Features such as message content, sender information, and frequency of messages may have been utilized to train the model. Implementing such a system helps users filter out unwanted messages, saving time and ensuring a better communication experience. 📱🛑

In summary, my internship journey has equipped with valuable skills in data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing. These projects not only showcase my technical abilities but also highlight my contribution to solving real-world problems.👨‍💻🔍
